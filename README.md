$ ionic serve

# opens the app in the browser but in a specialized ionic view
$ ionic serve --lab
```

### Generator

This app was generated using the [ionic cli](https://ionicframework.com/docs/cli/) and many commands were used to generate the desired components, pages, providers and pipes. You can find the full command list [here](https://ionicframework.com/docs/cli/commands.html).

## Building

To build and run the app on your phone, to test drive it, so as to say, you need android sdk, cordova and jdk configured in your system.
Connect the phone to your computer / start an emulator, ensure that you have turned on USB debugging from developer options in the settings of your phone. Try the following commands:

```sh
# builds a debug version of the android app
$ ionic cordova build android

# builds a debug version of the app and runs it on your android phone
$ ionic cordova run android

# builds a debug version of the ios app
$ ionic cordova build ios

# builds a debug version of the app and runs it on your iphone
$ ionic cordova run ios



# builds a production ready release version of your android app
$ ionic cordova build android --prod --release

# builds a production ready release version of your app and runs it on your android phone
$ ionic cordova run android --prod --release

# builds a production ready release version of your ios app
$ ionic cordova build ios --prod --release

# builds a production ready release version of your app and runs it on your iphone
$ ionic cordova run ios --prod --release
```
